In sprint 4, we successfully reached our goal as all our user stories are completed and we are ready to have the first release of our product. 

Since this was the last sprint, we did not add any new major features except for the completion of the ambient sounds player. However, we plan to work on improving our design for the next couple days until the presentation deadline. 

Looking back at sprint 4, we understood the importance of planning ahead. At the beginning of the project, we decided on a colour theme. But, we did not clearly define how our view was supposed to look like. For example, the font for our app, the layout of our view and much more. Since everyone worked on their module individually, our views all looked different at the end of sprint 3, making our application inconsistent. Therefore, for this sprint, we had to make a new user story dedicated to remaking all the views in order to create a constant theme throughout the app. This could have been easily prevented if we had a clear definition of the format of our view.

In addition to learning the importance of planning ahead, it taught us another valuable lesson, that is to have clear communication. If we had communicated with each other about our views, we would have realized that all of our views were turning out differently and we would have been able to come up with a clearly defined theme sooner.

Lastly, sprint 4 taught us the importance of thinking critically in terms of our user stories. Initially, one of our members' user stories was to make all views look consistent. However, midway through our sprint, we realized it would be better if we came up with a clear plan of how we want our view to look like and fix it individually since we knew best about the modules that we had written ourselves. This led to changing that user story into updating the view of a single module and changing the fonts in order to give the app a unified look. However, we realized on the last day that the view for two of our modules had not been changed and were causing inconsistency in the app. To solve this, we changed the user story from updating one view back to standardizing the view of the entire app.  

In order to improve our progress for the sprints in our next release or even future endeavours, we should work on planning components of our application better. For example, we should have an initial plan of our user interface and how we want our feature to turn out. This would lead to us having a clear definition of each user story, make our features consistent and even help us identify the scope of the user stories. 

Our best experience in sprint 4 was finally seeing our app come together. Our app is user friendly, has a lot of unique features and supports a good cause. Our app will help users experiencing mental health problems; a cause which we are all passionate about. We are all really proud of our application and will continue to make it better.
