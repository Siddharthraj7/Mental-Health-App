#### Sprint 3 Retrospective

Everyone has participated: Yes

In sprint 3, only one user story was left incomplete. The ambient noise player proved to be more difficult than expected. Hence, it was not completed by the end of the sprint and was moved to the next sprint.

We decided to add a number of new user stories to improve the current implemented features and standardize the look and feel of the app.

Looking back at sprint 3, we understood the importance of planning our commits better. As a result of merging one of the bigger user stories (navigation) last into dev, two user stories (motivational Quote, wallpaper) were impacted and were accidentally deleted due to a deletion committed in the navigation branch. From this we can learn that organizing our commits, and carefully merging is essential. This would have been prevented if we planned our code in the beginning. For example, if we had some idea on how much impact each task has on the rest of the tasks, we could have given more focus to the larger user story, ie, navigation. 

Additionally, we merged our stories at the last minute which meant we didn't have time left to fix any huge merge conflicts. This helped us realize the importance of time management and having some leeway time in case of emergencies such as this. 

In order to improve our progress for the next sprint we should work on planning our timelines better. For example, we should try to finish our user stories and leave the last day just to merge to dev/master and fix any issues that occur. 

Additionally, we should also improve our ability in determining the scope of user stories as we underestimated the level of the ambient noises user story. This could be solved by doing some research in advance. 

Our best experience in the last sprint was seeing more and more features being added to the app. The app feels like itâ€™s nearing completion and the end seems reachable.

Near the sprint completion deadline, we ran into some merge conflicts which lead to malfunctioning and missing code. This was disappointing as it felt like the features were not completed since the code did not function properly. The bugs that were encountered will be resolved in this sprint and we will be more careful during merges to assure that bugs are not introduced into the code.
