  Discussion: During our meeting, we decided on the user stories we need to complete, and divided the user stories into tasks. The user stories we are planning on completing this sprint are the registration, login and profile page view and database setup which are user stories 3, 4 and 5. Malaika will be responsible for setting up the database using firebase, and we will be using AndroidStudio for the entire application. Viju, Navya, and Jasmine will be responsible for creating the registration view, login page view and profile page view respectively. Fareeha, Alex, and Kavya will be responsible for connecting the database to the views and populating them with information from the database created. We also decided on a lavendar/lilac theme for our app as it is a very calming colour. Collectively we have decided that the tasks should be done by the wednesday before the sprint is due.

Release goals:
  1. Allow users to register and login to the application
  2. Enable past users to login into their account and view their profile/information
  3. Setup view and create logo and decide on a theme for the app
