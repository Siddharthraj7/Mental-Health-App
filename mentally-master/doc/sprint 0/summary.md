MentAlly is going to be an app designed to improve the quality of users' lives by tracking 
their mental well-being. Some of the highlighting features of our program will be the 
modules which allow our users to get access to professional help, play soothing meditation 
music, view their mood logs, and take customized questionnaires for diagnosis. Based on the 
information logged by the user, the app also gives feedback, reinforcing them to get back 
on track in terms of their mental health goals. Other than this, the app displays a new 
motivational quote on the home screen to enlighten users and keep them going. The overall 
motive of this app is to keep a person’s mental health in check and have all of the best 
features in one easy-to-use place.  

The main objectives of MentAlly will be to provide a peaceful, and calm environment for 
the user, enabling them to relax and have a calm mind. This means our view will make use 
of balanced tones, and softer shapes. Another key objective is to make the app like a “health” 
buddy with whom you can talk with and self-reflect. We want to make the app as customizable 
as possible in order to cater to the requirements of the user since every individual has 
unique needs. 

This app will be built such that it can be beneficial to everyone, of all age groups, but the 
specific audience would be young adults, as they often require a proper platform to express 
their feelings and make sense out of them.  

Scenario where MentAlly would help: Billy recently transitioned to a new school and has a tough 
time making new friends. He is often bullied, and has low self-esteem. MentAlly would help him 
feel better by providing him motivational quotes to boost his confidence, and give meditation 
tips so that he can calm his mind, and gain strength.

Some of the principles that our group follows for this app are:

1.Simplicity- We do not want to over-stimulate the user. 
2.Customizability- We want every user to be able to change things according to their preference.
3.Equality- Mental health issues are serious, so we must ensure we cater to a majority of them and provide the necessary support.
