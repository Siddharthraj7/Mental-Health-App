What we’re doing different:
- Our purpose is to make one app that acts as an all-in-one. This makes it very convenient for the user as they don’t need multiple apps that confuse them. Emergency contacts, questionnaires, ambient sounds, graphs, etc.
- It is a free app.

Audience:
- We are trying to target people who need mental health support/guidance. This includes all ages, genders and races.

Scenarios:
- If you want to track your emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.)
- If you want to keep a to-do list and check off actions.
- If you want some guidance on any mental health issues you may have.
- If you want to keep track of your emergency contacts and contact them in time of mental distress.
- If you want ways to calm your mental state down (i.e. listen to ambient music, breathing exercises).
- If you want to search up mental care services.
- If you want to track your habits (both positive and negative).

All of the apps listed above do NOT accommodate all of the scenarios we intend to. This app is meant to be a way to improve one's mental state and reach out for help if needed. It is an all-in-one app designed to be efficient and all services are available in a single place, which means it is easy to access and nagivate in time of distress/urgency.
