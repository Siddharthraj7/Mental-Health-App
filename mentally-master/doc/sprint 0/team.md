Meetup every Thursday from 3-4pm in one of the study rooms on campus. We will take turns for minutes and share on a google document with all teammates.

Meeting Prep:
- Bring laptops and at least one whiteboard marker
- Don't be late
- Inform team members as soon as possible if cannot make meeting
- Be enthusiastic and ready to contribute!
- Don't talk only about self; all team members should have equal chance to share their progress and problems

Version Control: Branches must be used to develop one user story. A separate branch should be made for each user story. Branches should only be merged once code has been throughly tested and reviewed. Do not push if code does not work. Instead get help from teammates.
Commit messages should be clear about what is being added in commit. Commits should not be too small or too large.

Division of work will be decided as a group during weekly meetings or through group chat.

Submissions:
- Deliverables should be submitted as soon as possible to avoid delays/issues near deadline
- The latest submission should be a few hours before deadline
- All group members should review submission
- Fareeha will make any final submissions required

Contingency Planning:
- If a team member drops the course, the workload will be divided equally between all other members
- If agreed upon tasks are not completed on time, we will try to discuss to find and resolve the issue that did not allow for the teammate to submit on time
	- If there are still issues we will meet with the professor to discuss next steps
- If a teammate is academically dishonest, the rest of the team will see the prof and let him know as soon as possible
